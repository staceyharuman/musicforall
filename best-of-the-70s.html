        <p class="top-5">Your Song - Elton John</p>
            <iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/38zsOOcu31XbbYj9BIPUF1" width="300" height="380" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>
    <p>Just as the song title states, the song was written as a gift to a significant other. Elton sings about how if he had all these other talents he would be able to give other kinds of gifts. However, being stuck with being a wonderful singer, he settles with gifting a song. The song was written at a time when Elton wasn’t completely out of the closet, so throughout the entire song gendered pronouns were avoided, except for the line “but, boy, if i did”, that hinted to his sexuality.

        <p class="top-5">Roxanne - The Police</p>

        <p>Although the contents of the song may not be appropriate for all ages, The Police had done an amazing job on conjuring up this song. The piano chords and laughter that you hear at the opening of the song was actually the result of The Police’s main vocalist, Sting, accidentally sitting on the piano. The song has been listed under the Grammy Hall of Fame for its unique flare.

        <p class="top-5">Let It Be - The Beatles</p>
            <iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/7iN1s7xHE4ifF5povM6A48" width="300" height="380" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>
    <p>The song was written by Paul Mccartney, who dreamed about his mother the night before he started on the song. In his dream, his late mother tells him to ‘let it be’ as if she knew the troubles that Paul was recently going through. He used the feeling that his mother’s words held to create a masterpiece of a song.</p>

        <p class="top-5">Big Shot - Billy Joel</p>
            <iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/22wxe2Yc9JzihICXYLGAQ7" width="300" height="380" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>
   <p>From the singer-songwriter who brought us classics such as We Didn’t Start the Fire, Uptown Girl and Piano Man, Billy Joel has mentioned that the song was written to himself for always out-doing others. After listening to this song, it’ll definitely be stuck in your head, with the phrase “You had to be a big shot, did ya?” resonating over and over again. The song caught my attention when it was performed by Brendon Urie on Billy Joel’s Honors Tribute.

        <p class="top-5">Don't Stop Me Now - Queen</p>

    <p>After the recent release of the movie Bohemian Rhapsody, Queen songs are currently trending again. The energetic feel of the song makes you want to dance uncontrollably while you’re alone in your room and scream at the top of your lungs. If you’re looking for a good time, remember to give Freddie a call!
